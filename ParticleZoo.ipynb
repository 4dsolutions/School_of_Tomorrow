    "# The Particle Zoo\n",

    "The idea of a \"zoo\" is not all that misleading, as in the animal and other kingdoms, we like to organize species or specimens according to a taxonomy, a categorization system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, protons and neutrons seem quite similar but for charge.  The fact that either may change into the other, perhaps with help from the outside, further connects them, although in particle world, species transforming into one another, according to a grammar, some rules, is the name of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, protons and neutrons, both nucleons, both made of quarks (by computation), both get to be baryons, a subtype of hadron.  Hadrons are composite "

    "#### The Standard Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets use Python's class hierarchy syntax to start to get a feel for the Standard Model.  The code below is far from complete.  It's merely suggestive.  We're just getting the ball rolling so to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the types below are for classification, i.e. Fermionic, Bosonic, Hadronic.  These are not particles as such, but categories of particle that may interact.  Subclasses of these types provide the actual Fermions, Hadrons (Baryons and Mesons) and Bosons (gauge and scalar).\n",

    "\n",
    "Gauge Bosons, as they're called, transmit the strong (gluon) and weak (W, Z) forces. Hadrons are made of odd (Baryon) or even (Meson) numbers of quarks.  Baryon subclasses include the Proton and Neutron.  Meson subtypes include tha Kaon and Pion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty much everything else is Fermionic and is either one of six types of a Quark or a Lepton.  Leptons, another category, considered elementary in the Standard Model (not made of Quarks, unlike Hadrons) include the charged electron, muon, tauon, and the neutral neutrino variant of each of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every particle comes with its own anti-particle, with the same mass, but other attributes switched from positive to negative, or left ot right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gluons, participating in quark interactions, come with another quantum attribute known as color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most hadrons are unstable standing alone, except for the proton.  The neutron, the next longest-living particle, holds together for some hours, before turning into proton while giving off an electron and anti-neutrino.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it weren't for the fact that super high speeds correspond to slower time passage, for such as the muons, we would not detect them in nature.  As it is, particle accelerators, such as the large hadron collider (LHC), are required to give sufficient longevity for detectability and classification. Even then, neutrinos are notoriously hard to detect, as they do not ordinarily react with other particles."
