We will know or shortly learn what a \"linear combination of vectors\" means (some of this, some of that... added). For example, the 12 ball centers in the CCP around a ball centered at (0,0,0,0) would be all 12 permutations of (2,1,1,0).  Those 12 points are each distance D from the origin. We're now in the IVM.\n",
