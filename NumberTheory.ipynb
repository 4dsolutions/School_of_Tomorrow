    "# Number Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Number Theory often begins with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: all positive integers may be distilled into a unique set of prime factors. If -1 is considered a prime factor, per J.H. Conway's suggestion, then all of $Z$ may be so distilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining whether a number is really prime or not, and therefore whether it has factors, is a difficult problem. The unfactorability of large composites is at the basis of the Rivest Shamir Adelson (RSA)method of public key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "The School of Tomorrow introduces number theory in steps, with a goal of making RSA comprehensible.  To this end, some vocabulary is needed, most specifically: prime, composite, totatives, totient, coprime (stranger) and modulo arithmetic i.e. operations relative to some modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers the modulo operator (%) and divmod as tools for doing modulo arithmetic."

    "\n",
    "Because older generations are concerned with how younger generations are introduced to their culture, the process of hammering out a curriculum tends to involve political considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to what extent was Number Theory purged from some curricula owing to [anti-German sentiment](https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Anti-German_Sentiment) and a wish to deprecate all things German?  Too much Gauss would never do, and yet he was a Principal.  Solution:  spend more time on Euclidean Geometry instead.  But did it have to be either / or?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes our Notebook will be more of a springboard, a diving board, into a deep well or chasm (sounds dramatic).  You may jump into Number Theory through Cryptography as well, and may wish to study them together.  Indeed, what has brought Number Theory back into vogue, if it ever went away, is the ubiquity (omnipresence) of cryptography in our daily lives today.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to learn about Fermat's Little Theorem, about totatives and totients, and about Diophantine Equations.  Even earlier, let's start out with Euclid's Method for the GCD (greatest common divisor), as one of the earliest numeric algorithms out there.\n",
