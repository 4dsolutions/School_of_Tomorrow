    "# Generating the Flextegrity Lattice\n",

    "Our purpose here is to elaborate a classic Python framework for storing and writing geometric information in a variety of formats, suitable for ray tracing and use within CAD programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target architecture we want to model is [Flextegrity](http://c6xty.com), a tension-compression lattice based on holding compression islands in relative positions, in an all-way space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CCP (Cubic Close Packing)\n",
    "The general case CCP lattice will form our background.  The cubic closest packed matrix of balls serves as our \"holodeck\" (our substitute XYZ grid), for \"tuning in\" our Flextegrity lattices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where spheres touch, they define the diamond faces of a rhombic dodecahedron, each tangent to twelve neighbors.  This marks the \"high water mark\" for sphere size (inter-tangency) and is the CCP itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As spheres begin to contract, without losing their relative positions, we're in a position to study alternative adjoining or holding strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How might these spheres still connect to each other in a way that preserves their intitial positions, and yet may allow from abberrational distortions, i.e. flexibility?  Our lattice is not brittle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CCP in Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The center-to-center strategy is well known to some architects as a space frame patented as the \"octet truss\" by R. Buckminster Fuller, and featured as \"kites\" in earlier studies by Alexander Graham Bell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "NASA went with the octet truss as a basic space frame for orbiting space station designs.\n",

    "## Python Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python framework we're developing has a generic purpose, of introducing simple vectorial geometry in conjunction with the Concentric Hierarchy well-known to School of Tomorrow students.  The content is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeletal Polyhedron below is meant to be subclassed and further fleshed out. This inherited piece provides mechanisms for resizing and translating the beast.  You may imagine adding rotation, as you learn more about vector-based computations based on technologies invented by Heaviside-Gibbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows operator overloading such that multiplying a Polyhedron object by a scalar (\\* triggers ```__mul__``` or ```__rmul__```) , say an int or float, will resize it in place.  A new Polyhedron is delivered however, following a more functional model with more immutability of state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the addition operator (+ triggers ```__add__``` or ```__radd__```), and supplying a vector (an arrow pointing to \"where it should move\"), the polyhedron may be translated (without resizing or rotating).  Again, the original polyhedron is unaffected, as only the face structure with labeled rings is essential topology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Acting on all the vertexes effectively scales and/or moves the object, but the Polyhedron so defined need not entangle itself with the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> t = Tetrahedron()\n",
    ">>> t2 = t + Qvector((2,1,1,0))\n",
    ">>> t2.edges  # re-distilled\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy in both cases (resizing or moving) is similar:  the vertexes are what anchor the whole show, are the tent stakes as it were.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To resize and move requires recomputing the vertexes, relative to an origin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, each subclass of Polyhedron needs to bring to the table its own dictionary of labeled faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per the Cube:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        # 6 faces\n",
    "        self.faces = (('a','f','c','h'),('h','c','e','b'),\n",
    "                      ('b','e','d','g'),('g','d','f','a'),\n",
    "                      ('c','f','d','e'),('a','h','b','g'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where these lowercase labels correspond to their uppercase global counterparts, the A-Z of the Concentric Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the faces, a Polyhedron knows how to distill all the edge pairs.  The Edge is a type of object all on its own, consisting of only two vectors.  A vector, by definition, has its tail at the origin, and so only carries the information for one point in space (relative the fixed origin).  An Edge connects any two vectors, so a Polyhedron may be considered a network of such edges."
