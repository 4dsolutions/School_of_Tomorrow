    "\n",
    "When creating the CCP, you might wish to start with a nuclear ball and then pack successive layers of 12, 42, 92, 162... balls in [a cuboctahedral conformation](https://oeis.org/A005901). \n",
    "\n",
    "![ccp_grow](ccp_grow.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing successive layers may be accomplished by adding all twelve vectors to adjacent balls to each ball in a layer, but only keeping it if it's new i.e. not already in the current or previous layer. The Python *set* data structure enforces such uniqueness. Our set members will be all-integer (non-negative) quadray coordinates of the CCP candidates. Determining uniqueness is fast and accurate when we're not hashing with fuzzy floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background, consider reading [Generating the FCC](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/Generating%20the%20FCC.ipynb) which contains a lot more information on the CCP, the source code below, and Quadrays more generally. \n",

    "### Consecutive Enumerated CCP Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Apex-outward packing suggests a pretty easy and intuitive consecutive ball number scheme. The apex ball is 1, and then when adding layers, use the already established orientations to see it is a matter of rastering down a page, reading left to right, top to bottom. So looking at L1 (layer 1) from the Blue side, with Green up top, we see the triangle always starting in an extreme Green direction, the next level up as it were. Then we go left to right, row by row, building a trying n+1 wider i.e. one higher frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a numbering strategy, we want our Python to enumerate for us. Questions arise as to how might we need to change the existing CCP apex-outward packing algorithm to accommodate sequential numbering, which means keeping track of every ball in a data structure, from which its number might be deduced. That could mean a list with the balls in order, however in the tweaked algorithm below we went with a dictionary, the ball's number the key, and the value the Quadray vector location of said ball."
