    "\n",
    "When creating the CCP, you might wish to start with a nuclear ball and then pack successive layers of 12, 42, 92, 162... balls in [a cuboctahedral conformation](https://oeis.org/A005901). \n",
    "\n",
    "![ccp_grow](ccp_grow.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing successive layers may be accomplished by adding all twelve vectors to adjacent balls to each ball in a layer, but only keeping it if it's new i.e. not already in the current or previous layer. The Python set data structure enforces such uniqueness. Our set members will be all-integer (non-negative) quadray coordinates of the CCP candidates.\n",

    "Thanks to a collaboration involving more attention to color-coding, I give each of the four quadrays its own color, envisioning the caltrop like a tripod radio tower, with Blue one of the ground based tips, and considered the \"radio broadcast station\" and therefore the beginning of our packing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The green tip defines the radio tower, from which emanate our IVM FM radio broadcasts.  Actually, a 1st layer starting with Blue is simply the remaining three (Green, Red, Yellow) and then onward, layer by layer, adding to a growing tetrahedron (four-eyes in the collaborator namespace) of successive triangular numbers of balls.\n",

    "\n",
    "Three pathways to the right and up will be sufficient.  Think of these as only some of (three of) the 12 spokes we would use if doing center-outward cuboctahedral packing.  We're confining our expansion to a single tetrahedron.\n",
