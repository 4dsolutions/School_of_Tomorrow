    "When creating the CCP, you might wish to start with a nuclear ball and then pack successive layers of 12, 42, 92, 162... balls in [a cuboctahedral conformation](https://oeis.org/A005901). \n",

    "Computing successive layers may be accomplished by adding all twelve vectors to adjacent balls to each ball in a layer, but only keeping it if it's new i.e. not already in the current or previous layer. The Python *set* data structure enforces such uniqueness. Our set members will be all-integer (non-negative) quadray coordinates of the CCP candidates. Determining uniqueness is fast and accurate when we're not hashing with fuzzy floats.\n",

    "### Consecutive Enumerated CCP Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Apex-outward packing suggests a pretty easy and intuitive consecutive ball number scheme. The apex ball is 1, and then when adding layers, use the already established orientations to see it is a matter of rastering down a page, reading left to right, top to bottom. So looking at L1 (layer 1) from the Blue side, with Green up top, we see the triangle always starting in an extreme Green direction, the next level up as it were. Then we go left to right, row by row, building a trying n+1 wider i.e. one higher frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a numbering strategy, we want our Python to enumerate for us. Questions arise as to how might we need to change the existing CCP apex-outward packing algorithm to accommodate sequential numbering, which means keeping track of every ball in a data structure, from which its number might be deduced. That could mean a list with the balls in order, however in the tweaked algorithm below we went with a dictionary, the ball's number the key, and the value the Quadray vector location of said ball."

    "## OctaPacking versus TetraPacking\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not done with our investigation until we look at another pattern natural to the IVM (CCP), that of the growing half-octahedron, or \"Egyptian Pyramid\" (EP) with a square base. Of course Egyptionologists often argue a true EP is anything but equi-edged, involving Phi (?) and so on. Many find these to be dubious claims. However, rather than wading into this debate, lets just switch attention to the \"stacking with oranges\" exhibit prevalent in textbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the cuboctahedral ball packing conformation makes clear (1, 12, 42, 92...), what we might call omnidirectional packing from a nucleus versus treating the initial ball as an apex, is that the CCP is buildable on a square-based foundation, where balls create only one set of valleys for the next layer.  The triangle-foundation leaves a choice as it presents twice as many valleys as we might need, two sets of valleys, call them B and C. The CCP goes ABCABC... whereas any number of permutations are possible, all giving \"Barlow Packings\" to use a term coined by J.H. Conway in correspondence with myself (and in other places I presume).\n",
    "\n",
    "By color-coding all 12 balls around the nuclear ball, I was able to pick out a set of four in a square arrangement that I could treat as a next layer (L1) after L0, the nuclear ball. The vectors to Yellow, Magenta, Grey, and Red, from a nuclear Orange, would be my pathways to every layer after that. Given any layer L(n), compute L(n+1) by trying all four pathways on each ball but in such a way as to disallow duplication. Only new balls will be kept, and those will be the balls of the next layer.\n",
