    "\n",
    "You might think of a photograph as a slice of time, like a slice of bread with some jam on it, where the jam is \"whatever is happening\" and where the slice has some thickness.  It takes time for photons to register on a chemical film, or on photosensitive resistors.  However a trend in photography has been to heighten the sensistivity of the recording material and to speed up the frame rate, meaning each individual slice of \"bread\" (time) is becoming less thick.  Slow motion movies take advantage of this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of movies, as soon as you put the time slices back together, you start to see rates of change.  In delta calculus, invented by Newton, Leibniz and other greats, we look for minimum changes (differentiation) however, then we add up those changes (integration) to get more summary results.  Even short movies, in placing one time slice after another in quick progression, say 30 frames per second (fps), may tell us a lot more about what we're looking at."

    "The time series in question might be \"one snap shot a day\" or \"one per second\" or \"one per 1/100th of a second\".  Or a time series might feature snap shots taken once a year, as when chronicling the slow advance or retreat of a glacier. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, given the wide range of instrumentation out there, you may not be getting literal photographs.  Most measurements, including images, have a numeric format and when it comes to noticing or registering differences, we may use numeric techniques rather than our own eyes and brains, to judge what a movie is showing.\n",
    "\n",
    "More likely yet, we use a combination of visualizations, intuitions, and numerical computations, in various feedback loops, to help build comprehension through apprehension (see Synergetics for more contextualizing passages).\n",
