    "The Quadcraft Project was originally developed by the Crescent City campus to encourage programmers to contribute to the pool of demo projects suitable for appending to [the Quadrays slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ynde13tnMAu7EelfVuQVTFDUWGYBcRDRmtkMu4LIUFw/edit?usp=sharing) (4D Solutions). \n",

    "[School of Tomorrow](https://github.com/4dsolutions/School_of_Tomorrow/blob/master/School_of_Tomorrow.ipynb) students will be able to eyeball the source code related to numerous implementations of the concepts, thereby reinforcing their mastery of the material while introducing them to alternative tool sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the UI are left to the programmer, but with up front guidance as to what a default implementation might include, in terms of dashboard display widgets and a main 3d canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the UI sketched below consists of four UAPs (UFOs) which think in terms of Martian Math (i.e. IVM coordinates) when moving from CCP ball to neighboring CCP ball. \n",
    "\n",

Likewise (a,b,c,d) + any (n,n,n,n) defines the same point. So to simplify to lowest terms: subtract the smallest (n,n,n,n) that makes one at least one of the four digits a zero (i.e. unused)."
