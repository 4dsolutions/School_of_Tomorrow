    "**Mathematics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back now to the mathematics of ancient Egypt, Milo Gardner sent the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "The purpose of this narrative is to outline meta Egyptian math topics that 21st century Egyptology scholars have not formally considered, and will not consider , until \"pushed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Old Kingdom mythic metaphors, stated in the Book of the Dead , continued in the Middle Kingdom. Most were unchanged, and actively energized in both the Old and Middle Kingdoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Egyptian scribes loved mythic and innovative math metaphors, developed in the Old Kingdom with both energized in the Middle Kingdom. Several math innovations in controlling the grain as wages were modified in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the centralized, top down, Old Kingdom duplation multiplication definition , arguably the oldest multiplication definition, appeared as one of three multiplication definitions in the Middle Kingdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first Middle Kingdom duplation multiplication definition was modified in the Berlin Papyrus. An inverse proportion, based on the pesu likely assisted in.solving two second degree equations. The inverse proportion unit was detected by Schackenberg (1900), asks several questions\n",
    "that Egyptologists need to try to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well kniwn.that Archimedes and Greeks used inverse proportion to approximate the square root of prime numbers , such as the square root of three, needed to extend the upper and lower limits of pi from 22/7. But, was the Greek inverse proportion method passed down from Egyptian sources. Ahmes may have improved pi = 256/81 understood pi = 22/7 , in RMP 38 reported\n",
    "\n",
    "320/320 x 7/22 = (101 + 9/11)(1/320)) x 22/7\n",
    "\n",
    "A second definition is found in the Akhmim\n",
    "Wooden Tablet and dozens of RMP problems. These problems were read by 20th century scholars as only Middle Kingdom duplation multiplication initial calculations , not noticing several final answers explicitly appeared in problem question statements . Statements\n",
    "and proofs followed the well known modem\n",
    "number theory axiom, multiplication and\n",
    "division were fully inverse to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third multiplication definition applied least common multiples (LCMsl as scaling factors to 2/table unit fraction series answers.the LCMs appeared in denominators and were larger than expected for 20th century scholars that randomly segmented 2/n table conversions to unit fraction series into three classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually , there was only one class of LCM\n",
    "scaling factors selected in 2/n table unit\n",
    "fraction series.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example , scribes solved 2/91 by subtracting 1/70 ( used LCM 70) by same method used in every RMP and KP 2/n table concise unit fraction series answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2/91 = (2/91 - 1/70) = (140 - 91)/(70)(91)\n",
    "= 1/70 + 1/130\n",
    "\n",
    "Scribes also mentally considered a third multiplication definition, with each LCM stated as a scaling factor (m/m) per:\n",
    "\n",
    "2/n (m/m) = (2mn - n)/mn\n",
    "\n",
    "The best divisors of mn were summed to (2m-n) by red auxiliary numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "2/43 = 2/43*(42/42)=(43 + 21 + 14 + 6)/1806 = 1/42 + 1/86 + 1/129 + 1/301\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication definition utilized prime numbers , a well known number theory idea (Oystein Ore, \"Number Theory and its History , 1948).\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for an Old Kingdom arithmetic metaphor that had been first written down within irrational planetary cycles, and approximated within an explicit recursive base10 numeration system, opens several\n",
    "doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "One well known door exposed infinite series predicates (questions) that were written down in the Eye of Horus notation:\n",
    "1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64\n",
    "\n",
    "What is not well known is that a finite base 10 solution was published in the Akhmim Wooden Tablet, stated with a volume unit context.The 1925 BCE AWT text was often ignored in the Cairo Museum from 1906 until 2002. The AWT was freshly photographed and analyzed by Hana Vymazalova in 2002 found that five divisions of one heqat by n = 3, 7, 10, 11, 13: restated to a multiplication context.\n",
    "\n",
    "All were exact, correcting Daressy (1906) that only found the n= 3, 7, 10 cases were exact, in a cubit context, amended by Peet (1923) to required ro = 1/320 of a heqat , a least common multiple (LCM).\n",
    "Quotient (Q) and Remainder (R) were scaled by 64/64 and 5/5 , respectively , one of several number theory facts were not reported in 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2014 is became clear to this researcher that the AWT was solved and proven by algebra, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "64/64 x 1/n = (Q/64 + (5R/n)(1/320)) x n = 64/64\n",
    "\n",
    "The masters student in Egyptology at Charles U, Prague followed an 1920s tradition, omitted the number theory sides of the AWT in 2002, by titling the five proof calculations of 64/64 as heqat unity , ending her paper citing Peet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1920s traditional was formalized in 1927 by Shute, et al, by transliterating the RMP, and the EMLR by the British Museum by oddly concluding that Egyptian arithmetic was only additive in the minds of scribes, offering no review of 50 years of German, and British scholarship on the subject, that offered different points of view .\n",
    "Simply stated, Shute, et al , and BM scholars threw out all hints and fragments of number theory by following a well known adage \" throw out the (number theory) baby with the bath water\" whenever Egyptian arithmetic was recorded by an Egyptian scribe, citing single false position seemed insufficient to Schack Schackenberg (1900), Hultsch (1895), and Sylvester (1891, 1880), and concluded, with little evidence , that Egyptian division was limited to single false position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearing a concluding comment Egyptian math scholarship commenced in 1864, with Berlin Papyrus discussions, and a famous incident that reported Germans pirating a copy of the RMP, from the British Museum, and publishing it in 1879.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concluding meta comment : Old Kingdom Infinite series traditions were passed down to the Middle Kingdom were structured by infinite series questions and solved by finite unit series have been one of several serious number theory omissions in virtually all Egyptian math papers published in the\n",
    "20th century. Much more calls out to be\n",
    "formally reported.\n",
